## DB_Discovery Software Module

The DB_Discovery module is designed to explore previously unknown relational databases and automatically discover 
their schema, extract Data Definition Language (DDL), and provide insights into the database's 
content and domain. Its primary purpose is to assist developers, data analysts, and domain experts 
in understanding the structure and content of databases, regardless of their underlying technology (e.g., 
PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, SQLite).

**DB_Discovery** is an advanced data science solution designed to **reverse engineer** unknown databases and datasets. It automates the discovery process by analyzing database structures, relationships, and key data components to generate an **intelligent schema**. The tool extracts **Data Definition Language (DDL)** scripts and produces **sample queries** for the most critical portions of the database, enabling users to quickly understand its structure and functionality.  

This solution is particularly useful for **legacy systems, undocumented databases, and large-scale data integration projects**, helping data engineers and analysts streamline their workflows by providing **automated insights** into any unknown dataset.
