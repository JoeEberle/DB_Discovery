**DB_Discovery: A Data Science Solution for Reverse Engineering Databases**  

**DB_Discovery** is an advanced data science solution designed to **reverse engineer** unknown databases and datasets. It automates the discovery process by analyzing database structures, relationships, and key data components to generate an **intelligent schema**. The tool extracts **Data Definition Language (DDL)** scripts and produces **sample queries** for the most critical portions of the database, enabling users to quickly understand its structure and functionality.  

This solution is particularly useful for **legacy systems, undocumented databases, and large-scale data integration projects**, helping data engineers and analysts streamline their workflows by providing **automated insights** into any unknown dataset.


## DB_Discovery Software Module

The DB_Discovery module is designed to explore previously unknown relational databases and automatically discover 
their schema, extract Data Definition Language (DDL), and provide insights into the databases 
content and domain. Its primary purpose is to assist developers, data analysts, and domain experts 
in understanding the structure and content of databases, regardless of their underlying technology (e.g., 
PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, SQLite).




## Core Functions of DB_Discovery

1. **Database Connectivity**     Establish connections with various types of relational databases. The function 
    supports multiple database management systems (DBMS) like PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, SQLite, and others 
    by leveraging universal database drivers (e.g., JDBC, ODBC, SQLAlchemy). Ensures compatibility across diverse
    database systems. Eliminates manual configuration by detecting and adapting to the target databases
    connection protocols.
2. **Schema Discovery**  Automatically retrieves the schema metadata, including table names, column names, data types, constraints, primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes.
Provides a comprehensive overview of the databases structure. Facilitates quick understanding of relationships between tables and their purpose.
3. **DDL Extraction**  Generates the databases DDL, including CREATE TABLE, CREATE INDEX, and other SQL statements required to recreate the schema in another environment.
Simplifies database replication or migration snd aids in creating backups of the database structure.
4. **Domain Analysis** Analyzes the data types, naming conventions, and relationships within the schema to infer 
the databases domain (e.g., e commerce, healthcare, finance). Provides context to help users align database usage with their organizational needs.
Accelerates domain specific insights without requiring subject matter expertise.
5. Data Sampling
Description Retrieves a small sample of data from each table to provide a preview of the content while avoiding performance overhead.
Value
Helps users understand the types of data stored.
Assists in data quality assessment and potential use case identification.
